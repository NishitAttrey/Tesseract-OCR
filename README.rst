High-Performance-OCR
====================
High-Performance-OCR is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That is, it will recognize and "read" the text embedded in images.

Pytesseract is a wrapper for `Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine <https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract>`_.
It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types
supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff,
and others. Additionally, if used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the recognized
text instead of writing it to a file.
