Tesseract-OCR
====================
Tesseract-OCR is optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That is, it will recognize and "read" the text embedded in images.

Pytesseract is a wrapper for `Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine <https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract>`_.
It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types
supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries.
